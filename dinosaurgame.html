          <h3>Dinosaur Game</h3>

          <p>
            The Dinosaur game is a very unique 2D platformer unlike any game I have ever seen. Two players play on the same computer. One person on the arrow keys and the other on the mouse. The game has two modes, singleplayer and multiplayer. The player on the arrow keys controls a a baby dino while the player on the mouse, also known as the architect, can click on any tile of the game and add or remove blocks. The original blocks that make up the level are unalterable but any blank space around the level is fair play for the architect. This creates an interesting dynamic as the architect can either help or hinder the player. In singleplayer, you can play in either Co-op or Vs. In both modes, the architect is limited to at most three blocks placed at a time. Any more and the oldest block vanishes. In Vs the architect tries to stop the dino by blocking simple jumps and stalling out the timer. In Co-op, the architect's job is to place blocks to make impossible jumps possible and get the player to the door at the end of the level to win. This requires coordination between both players to navigate the level as efficiently as possible. Now for the best mode and the mode I am most proud of: mulplayer. I use Node.js to create a local server in every computer running the game. Computers playing multiplayer send messages to their own local server and then the message is relayed to the other computer's local server. This makes it so I dont have to worry about running any server myself to make multilayer possible because every client machine running the game is also its own server. The drawbacks to doing this are that every computer running the game must have Node installed and run it the developer way and that only local multiplayer is supported. In multiplayer, there are two computers. This means there are two players controlling different color dino and two architects altering the game as its played. In this mode, there is no time limit and no limit to the number of blocks placed. Architects have to help their dino make it to the door, block the opponents dino, and also delete any blocks the opponent's architect placed to block his/her dino. This mode is very hectic, as you might assume, and has not yet been thoroughly tested to make sure it's balanced. The levels were designed in a program called Tiled and are stored in the project as .tiled files. The game was built using the Phaser.js game engine to generate the levels from the .tiled files, to calculate physics and hitboxes, and to handle sprite animation. I was able to alter the level files directly, when an architect places or deletes blocks, through Phaser as well, allowing the hitboxes to work without flaw even though the map is constantly changing.
